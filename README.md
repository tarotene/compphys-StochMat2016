This repo has a program for investigating the structure of stochastic matrices in Monte Carlo simulations, especially like <a href="https://github.com/tarotene/compphys-IsingFriction2016">that</a>. This is used to prove that a non-trivial perturbation on the stochastic matrix in the Monte Carlo simulation of a type of spin systems does not affect its eigenvalue distribution.

Notice: This repo have not been maintained for a long time, and probably only Mathematica files work properly.
