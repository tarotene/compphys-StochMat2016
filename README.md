This repo has a program for investigating the structure of stochastic matrices in Monte Carlo simulations, especially like <a href="https://github.com/tarotene/compphys-IsingFriction2016">that</a>. This is used to prove that a non-trivial perturbation on the stochastic matrix in the Monte Carlo simulation of a type of spin systems does not affect its eigenvalue distribution.

The programs in this repo was also used to generate data in the Ref.<sup>[1](#Sugimoto-Master-Thesis)</sup>.
